HangoutsNET
===========

The HangoutsNET chat network is a large series of interconnected parts. This repo does its best to place configuration for those parts, describe their installation and utility, and provide as a way for security-conscious peers to audit the source code.

This repository is not, however, comprehensive. There may be additional security on the network undocumented here for purposes of being tedious to describe and useless for software audit purposes. For example, automatic updates, restrictive permisssions, service separation, kernel modifications, and other potential updates.

Installation and Configuration
==============================

A markdown-formatted README is in each folder to describe the configuration and installation of each part.

The `update` file in the root of this repo should be placed in `/usr/local/bin/update`.
